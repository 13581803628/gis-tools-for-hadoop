{"name":"GIS Tools for Hadoop","tagline":"Big Spatial Data Analytics for the Hadoop Framework","body":"Looking at data without location, most of the time seems like looking at just part of a story. Including location and geography in analysis reveals patterns and associations that otherwise are missed. As Big Data emerges as a new frontier for analysis, including location in Big Data is becoming significantly important.\r\n\r\nData that includes location, and that is enhanced with geographic information in a structured form, is often referred to as Spatial Data. Doing Analysis on Spatial data requires an understanding of geometry and operations that can be preformed on it.  Enabling Hadoop to include spatial data and spatial analysis is the goal of this Esri Open Source effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Esri/gis-tools-for-hadoop\"><b><i>GIS\r\nTools for Hadoop </i></b></a>is an open source toolkit intended for Big Spatial Data Analytics. The toolkit provides different libraries:\r\n\r\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/Esri/geometry-api-java\"><b>Esri Geometry API for Java: </b></a><b></b>A generic geometry library, can be used to<b> </b>extend Hadoop core with vector geometry types and operations, and enables developers to build MapReduce applications for spatial data.\r\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/Esri/spatial-framework-for-hadoop\"><b>Spatial Framework for Hadoop</b></a><b>:</b> Extends Hive and is based on the Esri Geometry API, to enable Hive Query Language users to leverage a set of analytical functions and geometry types. In addition to some utilities for JSON used in ArcGIS.\r\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/Esri/geoprocessing-tools-for-hadoop\"><b>GeoProcessing Tools for Hadoop</b></a><b>:</b> Contains a set of ready to use ArcGIS GeoProcessing tools, based on the Esri Geometry API and Spatial Framework for Hadoop. Developers can download the source code of the tools and customize it; they can also create new tools and contribute it to the open source project. Through these tools ArcGIS users can move their spatial data and execute a pre-defined workflow inside Hadoop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"https://github.com/Esri/gis-tools-for-hadoop\"><b><i>GIS\r\nTools for Hadoop</i></b></a> toolkit allows users, who want to leverage the\r\nHadoop Framework, to do spatial analysis on spatial data; for example:\r\n\r\n1. Run Filter and aggregate operations on billions of spatial data records inside Hadoop based on spatial criteria.\r\n1. Define new areas represented as polygons, and run Point in Polygon analysis on billions of spatial data records inside Hadoop.\r\n1. Visualize analysis results on a map with rich styling capabilities, and a rich set of base maps.\r\n1. Integrate your maps in reports, or publish them as map applications online.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**<b>Getting started</b>**\r\n\r\n<p class=MsoNormal>Developers can get started at <a\r\nhref=\"https://github.com/Esri/spatial-framework-for-hadoop\">Spatial Framework\r\nfor Hadoop</a>.</p>\r\n<p class=MsoNormal>ArcGIS users can get started at <a\r\nhref=\"https://github.com/Esri/geoprocessing-tools-for-hadoop\">GeoProcessing\r\nTools for Hadoop</a>.</p>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
